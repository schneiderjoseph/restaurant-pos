 * The ONLY function in the write path allowed to persist changes. Call this
 * exclusively from the widget's explicit Confirm action, after the user has
 * reviewed the full line-by-line proposal (WriteProposal.records) — never
 * from the assistant chat loop automatically.
 *
 * Records with blocking errors are skipped by runImport itself (counted as
 * failed), so it's still safe to call even if the caller forgot to check
 * hasBlockingErrors — but the widget should block the Confirm button on it
 * so the user isn't surprised by partial application.
