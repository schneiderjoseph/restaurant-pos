- You MUST call render_chart at least once with data from prior tool results before giving the final answer.
- Provide only a short markdown summary (2–4 sentences) of key findings — no bullet lists, no tables, no ranked lists in prose.
- Reference each chart by title in the summary (e.g. "See chart: Daily Net Sales").
- Use line charts for trends/time series, bar charts for rankings/comparisons, pie charts for proportions.
- If you fetched time-series or weekly sales data, always render it as a line chart.`,

  ## Trends
  ## Recommendations

- Delivery orders: only when the user says "delivery" — use get_orders with deliveryOnly=true. Otherwise list ALL orders for the requested statuses (dine-in, takeaway, delivery, etc.).
- "Pending or progress" means statuses Pending AND In Progress — never restrict to delivery unless asked.
- Use get_orders to list/filter orders by status (e.g. open In Progress orders). Use get_sales_summary only for completed/paid sales KPIs.
- Order items link to dishes (menu_item / ${Tables.dishes})
- Menu catalog: ${Tables.dishes} (active items have deleted_at = NONE). Use list_menu_items for the full catalog.
- For "products that haven't sold" / unsold menu items: use get_unsold_products (compares full menu vs paid sales). Do NOT use get_top_selling_dishes alone — it only returns items that sold.
- Order voids: ${Tables.order_voids}
- Inventory items: ${Tables.inventory_items} (reorder_levels: per-location minimum quantity map), locations: ${Tables.inventory_locations} (stock SoT), legacy stores: ${Tables.inventory_stores}
- Admin kitchens (${Tables.kitchens}) are POS-only — not stock locations.
- Stock on-hand: ${Tables.inventory_ledger} keyed by inventory_location (posted documents only). Adjustments: ${Tables.inventory_adjustments}. Purchases/issues/waste remain document history.
- Purchase Orders (${Tables.inventory_purchase_orders}): approval workflow documents with statuses Draft, Pending Approval, Approved, Fulfilled. Use get_purchase_orders for PO / purchase-order questions. Do NOT use get_orders (POS customer orders) or get_inventory_movements type "purchase" (posted purchase ledger) for PO questions.
- Day closings: ${Tables.closings}, Activity tracking: ${Tables.tracking}
- Tip amounts on paid orders: order.tip_amount (use get_tips — matches Advanced Sales tips column)
- Saved tip distribution records: ${Tables.tip_distributions} (finalized after Tip Distribution screen — may be empty until saved)
- Staff clock-in sessions: ${Tables.time_entries} (active session = clock_out is NONE). Use list_active_sessions for who is clocked in. Use get_current_session_sales for per-order-taker sales during their current session.

const FULL_WORKFLOW = `Workflow:
1. Call the appropriate data tool for the question domain (sales, inventory, operations).
2. Date range is optional. If the user does not mention a time period, omit startDate and endDate to query all available data.
3. For relative time periods ("today", "this month", "last week", etc.): call resolve_date_range with the phrase, OR pass phrase directly to data tools — never invent startDate/endDate yourself.
4. Anchor all relative dates to the current business date provided above (e.g. "this month" means the current calendar month, not a past year).
5. For sales/consumption trend forecasts: always call get_time_series first, then forecast_sales or forecast_inventory. Never project from memory.
5a. For inventory needed / this Friday / what should I buy / restock: call forecast_inventory_need only. Report last same-weekday actual, on-hand, adjusted need, suggestedPurchaseQty, and context (holidays, weather, prompt events). Do not create a purchase order. Pass localEvents from the prompt; never invent. If weather is missing, say so from warnings.
5b. For how many staff / headcount needed: call forecast_staff_need only. Report last same-weekday hours/headcount vs recommended vs scheduled. Pass localEvents from the prompt; never invent.
6. For discounts: prefer get_discount_summary (includes order_discounts engine records). For "today" prompts always pass phrase or resolved dates.
7. For order lists by status (In Progress, Paid, etc.): use get_orders with statuses — never use get_sales_summary or get_order_lifecycle for this. Make each invoice number a markdown link to /reports/order-receipt?id={orderId}.
7a. For a concrete order id (order:…) or "everything / full history / detail for this order": use get_order_detail. Report items[].dishName as dishes; include voids, discounts, taxes, payments, fiscals, prints, tracking, and timeline. Do not reconstruct dishes only from tracking. Include a markdown link to /reports/order-receipt?id={order.id}.
7b. For purchase orders / POs / pending approval: use get_purchase_orders — never get_orders and never get_inventory_movements type "purchase".
8. For unsold / no-sales products: use get_unsold_products with phrase like "last 60 days" — never infer unsold items from get_top_selling_dishes or get_product_mix alone.
9. For current clock-in session sales per order taker: use get_current_session_sales — not get_server_sales (which uses date ranges, not time_entry sessions).
10. For tips collected / tip distribution shares: use get_tips with phrase (e.g. today). tipsCollected sums order tip_amount on paid orders. projectedShares shows each staff member's weighted share from tip_distribution settings.
11. For server speed: get_server_ticket_times. For staff accountability (voids/discounts/deleted items): get_staff_accountability_metrics.
12. For menu engineering (Plowhorses/Puzzles): get_menu_engineering_matrix. MoM volume drops: get_menu_sales_trends. Price impact: estimate_price_change_impact.
13. For hourly labor % vs sales / over-staffing: get_hourly_labor_vs_sales with phrase (last Friday, peak hours).
14. For prep delays by channel: get_prep_times_by_order_type. Kitchen bottlenecks: get_kitchen_station_delays.
15. For cash orders modified before close: get_cash_settlement_audit. Void/cancel/comp reasons: get_void_and_cancel_summary.
16. For accounting/GL: get_trial_balance, get_balance_sheet, get_profit_loss, get_cash_flow, get_general_ledger, get_journal_entries, get_account_statement, list_accounts. Use posted journal data only.
17. For fraud/suspicious/unauthorized activity: start with get_voids, get_staff_accountability_metrics, and get_cash_settlement_audit. Call get_activity_log only when findings need tracking/payload detail (use a narrow date range and limit — do not fetch tracking first).
18. For charts: call render_chart with data from prior tool results in the same conversation.
19. For comparisons: use compare_periods with two explicit date ranges.
20. Answer in clear, concise language with specific numbers from tool results.
21. State forecast method, history range, and that projections are estimates.`;
