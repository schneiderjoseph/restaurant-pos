# .devia — living memory for posr-react

This folder is the project's memory. It is read **before** any work and updated **with** every
change. It is not documentation: it is the short, indexed truth an agent needs to stop guessing.

Created by `devia init` (devia 0.9.0, 2026-10-02).

| 14 | [`14_INDEX.md`](14_INDEX.md) | Where do I find X? |

Machine files: [`devia.json`](devia.json) (profile, maturity, pinned version, context budget),
[`decisions.yaml`](decisions.yaml) (the decision register) and
[`impact-map.yaml`](impact-map.yaml) (change type → files to update).

The standard itself is not copied in here. Read it with `npx devia rules --id SEC-001` or
`npx devia rules --domain database`, which is the same text for every agent. If you need it on
disk — an agent with no network, or an audit that must show the exact wording you built against
— `npx devia sync` pins a version-locked copy under `standard/`, and `14_INDEX.md` then points
at it.

## Reading this is not reading all of it

Everything above plus the rule registry is more than one task needs. Ask for the slice:

```bash
npx devia context "add POST /api/orders"
npx devia context "fix the empty state" --files src/components/Orders.tsx --explain
```

It returns this project's own never/always lines, the blocking rules for the surfaces involved
and the impact-map duty first, then whatever else fits the target in `devia.json`
(`context.budget`).

Three numbers are always reported, because they are three different things:

```text
Target              1200   what you asked for
Mandatory floor      962   what the blocking items cost
Selected            1187   what you got
```

`context.mode` decides what happens when the floor is larger than the target. `advisory` (the
default) delivers the mandatory items whole and says `OVER TARGET`; `strict` never exceeds the
target and compresses them toward their identifiers instead, never dropping one.

Keeping `10_NEVER_ALWAYS.md` pruned matters here: every line is admitted before the target is
consulted, so a line nobody has ever violated costs every task that runs after it.

## The three registries

| File | Means | Never |
|---|---|---|
| `decisions.yaml` | The questions this kind of project always has. | Treat `pending` as permission |
| `11_GAPS.md` | A question somebody hit while working. Nobody has ruled. | Quietly pick an answer and code it |
| `12_DEBT.md` | Decided, not built. | Delete a line you did not discharge |

The register holds the **known** unknowns — enumerated before the work starts, from what this
kind of project is. The gap registry holds the ones nobody saw coming. Both mean the same thing
to an agent about to write code: an undefined decision is not an implicit permission
(`DEC-001`).

```bash
npx devia decide                 every slot, grouped, with its status
npx devia decide pending         only what nobody has ruled on
npx devia decide set stack.framework "16.x" --package next --because "..."
npx devia decide delegate testing.framework --bounded-by "runs in CI with no network"
npx devia decide drop content.imagery --because "this product ships no imagery"
```

Four statuses, because absence of information and absence of need are different facts:
`decided`, `pending`, `delegated`, `not_required`.

## Maintenance

```bash
npx devia validate    # structure, registries, placeholders
npx devia doctor      # is the memory older than the code?
npx devia check       # readiness gates
npx devia sync        # pin the standard under standard/, or refresh a pinned copy
```

`.devia/` is committed. It is part of the repository, not a local scratch pad.

## If devia itself is what went wrong

`npx devia contribute` turns a devia problem you hit here into an issue or a pull request. It
runs locally, builds a standalone reproduction rather than sending this repository, sanitizes
anything you explicitly include, prints every byte before sending, and sends nothing without
`--yes`. A candidate is only eligible once devia has reproduced the problem itself.

Records live in `contributions/`; the generated `payload/` is disposable and gitignored. Turn
the feature off entirely with `"contribution": { "enabled": false }` in `devia.json`.
