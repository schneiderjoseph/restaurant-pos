## Standard

The standard is read through the CLI, not copied into this repository.

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| A rule by ID | `npx devia rules --id SEC-001` |
| Every rule in a domain | `npx devia rules --domain database --priority P0` |
| Work contract | `AGENTS.md` at this repository's root |
| Readiness gates | `npx devia check` |

`npx devia sync` pins a version-locked copy under `standard/` when an agent must read it
offline, or when an audit needs the exact wording you built against. Add the paths here if you
do.
