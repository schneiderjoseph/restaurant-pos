# AGENTS.md — work contract for posr-react

You are working on **posr-react** under devia 0.9.0.
This file is your contract. Violating it is a failed task.

## Before you touch anything

1. Read [`10_NEVER_ALWAYS.md`](10_NEVER_ALWAYS.md) — what this project has already banned
2. Read [`00_OVERVIEW.md`](00_OVERVIEW.md) — what this project is
3. Read the memory file for the surface you are about to change ([`14_INDEX.md`](14_INDEX.md))
4. Read the rules for what you are touching: `npx devia rules --domain <name>`, or
   `npx devia rules --id <ID>` for one

Then work. Then update this memory in the same change.

## Non-negotiable here

- Never invent an endpoint, field, config key or business rule. Unknown means **ask**, or record
  it in [`11_GAPS.md`](11_GAPS.md) — not a quiet default (`AGT-004`, `MEM-001`)
- A `pending` line in [`decisions.yaml`](decisions.yaml) is **not permission to choose**. No
  brand, no palette, no framework version, no robots policy decided as a side effect of
  implementation. Build around it, or say what it blocks (`DEC-001`)
- You decide only where the register says `delegated`, and only inside `bounded_by` (`DEC-002`)
- A missing asset stays missing. Never generate a stand-in for one (`DEC-005`)
- Decided but not built goes in [`12_DEBT.md`](12_DEBT.md), even when you are not fixing it
  (`MEM-002`)
- Smallest change that satisfies the request; no opportunistic refactors (`AGT-003`)
- Never disable a test, skip a hook, or weaken a rule to go green (`TST-003`, `OPS-003`,
  `AGT-011`)
- Never claim done or production ready without naming the checks that ran (`AGT-005`)
- Always report what you did **not** verify (`AGT-006`)
- Update `.devia/` in the same change, per [`impact-map.yaml`](impact-map.yaml) (`MEM-009`)

## Checks

```bash
npx devia context "<task>"   # the rules that apply here, not all of them
npx devia decide pending     # what nobody has ruled on — read before you assume
npx devia validate           # memory integrity
npx devia check              # readiness gates (P0 blocks)
```

TODO(devia): add this project's own commands — install, dev, test, lint, migrate.

## Output contract

```text
