# Orders

The Orders screen lists open and recent checks so you can pay, print, split, merge, cancel, or refund without returning to the floor plan.

### Orders layout

Open Orders from the left sidebar. Filters sit at the top; order cards (or table rows) fill the main area.

1. Tap Orders in the sidebar.
2. Use filters to narrow by status, order type, floor, user, and date.
3. Switch between Blocks and Table views with the toolbar buttons.

### Filters

1. Status: In Progress, Paid, Cancelled, Split, Merged (multi-select).
2. Order type, floor, and user filters limit who and where.
3. The date picker scopes the list to that calendar day (today by default). Unpaid checks from other days stay hidden until you pick that day; an order taken earlier but due on the selected day still appears.
