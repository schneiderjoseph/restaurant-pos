# Security Hardening — `security/hardening` branch

This branch fixes the critical security defects identified in the POSR audit
(2026-08-27). Every change is backwards-compatible at the configuration level —
operators who already set the documented env vars see no behaviour change;
operators who relied on insecure defaults will be **forced** to set them.

## Summary of fixes

| # | Severity | Fix | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Critical | Removed the real-looking JWT secret shipped in `.env.example`. Replaced with a placeholder that literally tells the operator to run `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"`. Also blanked `VITE_PAYMENT_CALLBACK_SERVER_URL` (was hardcoded to the maintainer's production domain). | `.env.example`, `api/.env.example` |
| 2 | High | API CORS no longer fails open. Previously, when `API_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` was unset the API called `cors(undefined)` which allows **all** origins — inconsistent with the gateway's strict policy. Now the API denies every cross-origin request by default, same posture as the gateway. | `api/server.js` |
| 3 | High | `/auth/login` is now rate-limited. A 4-digit PIN has only 10,000 combinations; without rate limiting an attacker could brute-force any PIN in minutes (bcrypt slows but does not stop this). Two buckets: per-IP and per-login. Default: 5 failures → 15 min lockout. Configurable via `AUTH_LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `AUTH_LOGIN_LOCKOUT_MS`, `AUTH_LOGIN_WINDOW_MS`, `AUTH_LOGIN_BYPASS_IPS`. | `gateway/src/rate-limiter.js` (new), `gateway/src/auth.routes.js` |
| 4 | High | `/fiscal/invoice` is now protected by an SSRF allow-list. Previously the endpoint accepted any http(s) URL from the SPA and proxied it server-side, turning the API into an open relay for probing internal IPs (including `169.254.169.254` IMDS). Defaults allow the known Pakistan fiscal authorities (FBR, PRA) + loopback; strict mode via `FISCAL_ALLOWED_UPSTREAMS_STRICT=true`. | `api/src/modules/fiscal/fiscal.controller.js` |
| 5 | High | `token.crypto.js` now refuses to encrypt OAuth tokens when `NODE_ENV=production` and `INTEGRATION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is unset. Previously it silently fell back to a `PLAINTEXT:` prefix with only a warning — meaning production deployments could end up storing live QuickBooks OAuth tokens in plaintext. Decrypt still accepts legacy `PLAINTEXT:` payloads so operators can migrate by setting the key and re-saving each credential. | `api/src/modules/integrations/shared/token.crypto.js` |
| 6 | High | Removed the `SURREAL_USER \|\| 'root'` / `SURREAL_PASS \|\| 'root'` fallback from all 13 migration / backfill scripts. The runtime services (gateway, api, payments, printing, tracking) were already fixed by a prior commit, but the migration tooling still silently fell back to `root`/`root`. Now they refuse to run unless the env vars are explicitly set. | `migrations/scripts/apply-migration.{cjs,sh}`, `migrations/scripts/run-prod-migrations.cjs`, `migrations/scripts/backfill-*.cjs`, `migrations/scripts/backfill-workflows.js`, `scripts/{seed,backfill,migrate}-discounts.mjs` |
| 7 | Critical | PayPal webhook driver no longer defaults `signatureValid = true`. Previously, any webhook POST without a `metadata.paymentTypeId` (or with a mis-configured payment type) bypassed signature verification and was persisted to the `payment_webhook` table — which the POS polls and trusts as "paid". An attacker who knew an orderKey (predictable: `order:<invoiceNumber>`) could forge a paid result. Now `signatureValid` defaults to `false`; unsigned acceptance requires explicit `PAYPAL_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS=true` (mirrors the JazzCash pattern). Also added a belt-and-suspenders guard in the controller: never persist a result whose driver marked `signatureValid === false`. | `payments/src/gateways/drivers/paypal.gateway.js`, `payments/src/controllers/webhooks.controller.js` |
| 8 | Medium | `docker-compose.yml` backup service: removed the inner `${SURREAL_USER:-root}` fallback inside the generated `run-backup.sh` (compose-level `${SURREAL_USER:?}` already enforces it, but the inner fallback would have taken effect if someone ran the script manually with unset env). Added a security note about the `docker.sock` mount with a recommendation to use a Docker socket proxy in production. | `docker-compose.yml` |
| 9 | Medium | Gateway JWT revocation is now durable. Previously revoked JTIs were kept in an in-memory `Set` — a process restart revalidated already-revoked sessions until their natural TTL expired. Now revocations persist to a `revoked_session` Surreal table (with migration); the in-memory cache is still used as a fast path on every request. Degrades gracefully to in-memory-only if Surreal is unreachable. | `gateway/src/revocation-store.js` (new), `gateway/src/jwt.js`, `gateway/server.js`, `migrations/2026_08_27_revoked_session_store.surql` (new) |

## New regression tests

- `gateway/src/rate-limiter.test.js` — 5 tests: threshold + lockout, per-IP vs per-login buckets, bypass list, Retry-After header.
- `gateway/src/revocation-store.test.js` — 7 tests: in-memory revoke/isRevoked, idempotency, negative cache, bootstrap fallback.
- `payments/src/gateways/drivers/paypal.gateway.bypass.test.js` — 4 tests: missing paymentTypeId, missing webhookId, explicit unsigned opt-in, default rejection.

All 16 new tests pass. The 56 pre-existing backend regression tests still pass.

## Configuration changes operators must apply before deploying this branch

| Variable | Required for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET` | Always | Must be regenerated per deployment. `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"` |
| `SURREAL_USER` / `SURREAL_PASS` | Always | Must match the existing SurrealDB root user. |
| `API_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | If you want any cross-origin API access | Previously the API was open when this was unset; now it denies by default. |
| `FISCAL_ALLOWED_UPSTREAMS` | Optional | Defaults to Pakistan fiscal authorities + localhost. Set `FISCAL_ALLOWED_UPSTREAMS_STRICT=true` to deny the defaults. |
| `INTEGRATION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Production | `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`. Required when `NODE_ENV=production`. |
| `NODE_ENV=production` | Production | Enables the hard-refusal paths in `token.crypto.js`. |
| `AUTH_LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | Optional | Default 5. |
| `AUTH_LOGIN_LOCKOUT_MS` | Optional | Default 900000 (15 min). |
| `AUTH_LOGIN_BYPASS_IPS` | Optional | Comma-separated IPs that skip rate limiting. |
| `PAYPAL_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS` | Dev/test only | Accept unsigned PayPal webhooks. Default `false`. |

## Items deliberately NOT addressed in this branch

These are documented in the audit report but require an architectural decision
and larger changes; they are tracked separately:

- **SurrealDB `PERMISSIONS` on all 143 tables.** Today every table has
  `PERMISSIONS FULL` and the Surreal token handed to the browser is
  root-scoped — RBAC is purely client-side. Fixing this requires defining a
  SurrealDB role model, an audit of every query, and end-to-end testing of
  every screen. Recommended as a follow-up branch `security/surreal-rbac`.
- **Encryption of payment-gateway credentials at rest.** The `payments`
  service stores Stripe secret keys, M-Pesa consumer secrets, Telebirr RSA
  private keys etc. as plain rows in Surreal — unlike the `api` service's
  `CredentialStore` which encrypts via `token.crypto.js`. Porting the same
  pattern is mechanical but touches every gateway driver's `mapCredentials`.
  Recommended as a follow-up branch `security/encrypt-payment-credentials`.
- **Rate limiting on other auth endpoints** (`/auth/db-token`, `/auth/session`).
  Less critical than `/auth/login` (they require a valid session already), but
  worth adding for defence in depth.

## How to verify the fixes locally

```bash
# 1. Run the gateway test suite (includes new rate-limiter + revocation tests)
cd gateway
GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))") \
  node --test src/jwt.test.js src/surreal-client.test.js src/rate-limiter.test.js src/revocation-store.test.js

# 2. Run the API + payments + printing + tracking regression suites
cd ../api && GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET=<as above> SURREAL_USER=test SURREAL_PASS=test \
  node --test src/lib/session-auth.middleware.test.js src/lib/surreal-client.test.js
cd ../payments && (same env) node --test src/lib/session-auth.middleware.test.js src/lib/surreal-client.test.js \
  src/gateways/drivers/paypal.gateway.bypass.test.js
cd ../printing && (same env) node --test session-auth.middleware.test.js
cd ../tracking-api && (same env) node --test src/session-auth.middleware.test.js src/surreal-client.test.js

# 3. Apply the new migration
SURREAL_USER=posr SURREAL_PASS=<your-pass> ./migrations/scripts/apply-migration.sh \
  migrations/2026_08_27_revoked_session_store.surql
```
